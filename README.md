Project Title: Covid-19 Chatbot

Problem Statement/Opportunity: A chatbot to address questions everything about Covid-19 and the latest Omicron variant.

Project Description: In this unforeseen Covid-19 pandemic situation, there are many misconceptions and confusions about the virus among the people. 
There are many FAQ sections on the web, but people find it difficult to get there and read, also they are lazy to log on to these sites. 
Various social media platforms are misguiding people with very different and illegal solutions/answers for their questions. 
Thus, this project provides a very simplified and user-friendly chatbot to provide answers from WHO and Government trusted source/knowledge base
