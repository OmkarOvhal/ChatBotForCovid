Project Description: In this unforeseen Covid-19 pandemic situation, there are many misconceptions and confusions about the virus among the people. 
There are many FAQ sections on the web, but people find it difficult to get there and read, also they are lazy to log on to these sites. 
Various social media platforms are misguiding people with very different and illegal solutions/answers for their questions.
